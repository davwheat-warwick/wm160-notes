## Induction quiz overview

### Question 1

> Which sampling method is in use?
>
> Three postcodes in England are selected at random and all prices of houses for sale in those postcodes are collected

**Cluster sampling**

- Population is all of the UK
- Clusters are the postcodes
- All items in the cluster are evaluated

### Question 2

> Which sampling method is in use?
>
> 50 boys and 50 girls are selected at random from the students in a college.

**Stratified sampling**

- Choosing random samples of pre-selected groups to try to prevent bias

### Question 3

> Which sampling method is in use?
>
> Every tenth person from those registered on a website is surveyed about his/her satisfaction with the website.

**Systematic**

- No random choice
- Choosing one in N people without any other consideration

### Question 4

> A college wants to sample its students to find out how much they would be willing to pay for lunch.
>
> Two possible sampling methods are suggested:
>
> A) Take a random sample of 100 students and email the survey to them.
>
> B) Put the survey on the college website and wait until 100 students have responded before closing the survey.
>
> Which of these methods is likely to give the more representative sample?

**A**

- B is self-selective, and only covers people who use the website
- A removes bias through fully random selection

## Vevox activity

### Poll 1 - populations

> Take a moment to think about a population of "something". (Maximum 2)

- people
- houses

Both of these are populations, in different senses. Going back to the [induction quiz questions](#question-1), houses are a population here.

### Poll 2 - simple random sampling

> Which of the following is a simple random sample?
>
> 1. A numbered list of all students at Warwick, and selecting every 10
> 2. A numbered list of all students at Warwick, and using a random number generator to select pupils at random

**2**

- number 1 is systematic

### Poll 3 - sampling

> Sharon selects 30 girls and 30 boys at random from a list of all students in her school.
>
> What sampling method is this?

**Stratified sampling**

### Poll 4 - sampling

> Jamie wants to collect data about whether Facebook users use other types of social media as well.
>
> He posts a survey on his Facebook page and asks for responses.
>
> What sampling method is this?

**Self-selected sampling**

- 52.5% said _opportunity sampling_, which was incorrect
- Since Jamie has _asked for responses_, this is self-selected sampling
  - If he didn't explicitly ask for responses, it would be opportunity sampling
- Both could be argued as correct, though, since asking for responses is typically implied in a survey like this

### Poll 5

> Sharon selects 30 girls and 30 boys at random from a list of all students in her school.
>
> Jamie wants to collect data about whether Facebook users use other types of social media as well. He posts a survey on his Facebook page and asks for responses.
>
> 1. Both samples are likely to be biased
> 2. Sharon's sample is likely to be biased, and Jamie's is not
> 3. Jamie's sample is likely to be biased, and Sharon's is not
> 4. Neither sample is likely to be biased

**Jamie's sample is likely to be biased, and Sharon's is not**

- The use of stratified sampling in Sharon's population helps to reduce bias
- Self-selection is typically more biased
- Stratified sampling doesn't _eliminate_ bias, but is is less likely to introduce bias

### Poll 6

> Roseline wants to collect data about the length of words in books for young children.
>
> She selects 3 books, and writes the length of the 3rd word in every sentence of the book.
>
> Which sampling method is this?

~~Systematic sampling~~ **Cluster sampling**

- The three books are not selected at random, but still act as clusters
- Systematic sampling is utilised within the clusters
- Cluster sampling is the overarching sampling method used, with systematic used inside the clusters

### Poll 7

> A phone company wants feedback from customers.
>
> Which of the following give a representative sample?
>
> 1. Randomly calling a set of customers between 10 am and midday on a weekday
> 2. Randomly calling a set of customers between 7 pm and 9pm on a weekday
> 3. Sending emails to a randomly chosen set of customers with a survey, asking them to respond
> 4. None

**None of the above**

- Self-selecting (email) is the more representative option, but still introduces bias through self-selection
- If someone was significantly more dissatisfied or satisfied, they would be more likely to respond to the survey

### Poll 8

> Peter wants to collect data about voting intentions in his local consitiuency.
>
> Which of the following provides a simple random sample?
>
> 1. Select at random from the phone book
> 2. Select at random from the electral roll
> 3. Select at random from a list of addresses

**Electoral roll**

- Not everyone is in a phone book
- At addresses, there are likely multiple people eligible to vote, or noone at all
- Electoral roll is the most complete population, hence the most appropriate choice
